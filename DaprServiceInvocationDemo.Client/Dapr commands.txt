NOTE: you must be inside the DaprServiceInvocationDemo.Client subfolder for this to work

NOTE: the client needs no port because it is not listening for anything

NOTE: if you run the client app without using "dapr run" it will fail because it will have no sidecar
        and therefore cannot determine the service location

dapr run --app-id weather-client dotnet run
